class SharedLock:
    """A shared (read-write) lock without a defined priority between read and write tasks.

    You may use the lock as a usual lock, but the operations of acquire and release are per
    each kind of operation. You must also specify an underlying kind of lock.

        >>> from threading import Lock

        >>> lock = SharedLock(Lock)

        >>> def append(l, x):
        ...     lock.acquire_write()
        ...     l.append(x)
        ...     lock.release_write()
        ...     return f'{x}_write'

        >>> def get_value(l, i):
        ...     lock.acquire_read()
        ...     x = l[i]
        ...     lock.release_read()
        ...     return f'{x}_read'

        >>> from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed

        >>> def execute(read, write):
        ...     l = [1, 2, 3]
        ...     p = {'1_read', '2_read', '4_write', '5_write'}
        ...     with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
        ...         f1 = executor.submit(write, l, 4)
        ...         f2 = executor.submit(read, l, 0)
        ...         f3 = executor.submit(write, l, 5)
        ...         f4 = executor.submit(read, l, 1)
        ...
        ...         for fut in as_completed([f1, f2, f3, f4]):
        ...             assert fut.result() in p

        >>> execute(get_value, append)


    You can also use `write_operation` and `read_operator` context managers:

        >>> def append(l, x):
        ...     with lock.write_operation:
        ...         l.append(x)
        ...     return f'{x}_write'

        >>> def get_value(l, i):
        ...     with lock.read_operation:
        ...         x = l[i]
        ...     return f'{x}_read'

        >>> execute(get_value, append)


    As a better alternative you can use `write_operation` and `read_operator` as decorators:

        >>> @lock.write_operation
        ... def append(l, x):
        ...     l.append(x)
        ...     return f'{x}_write'

        >>> @lock.read_operation
        ... def get_value(l, i):
        ...     x = l[i]
        ...     return f'{x}_read'

        >>> execute(get_value, append)

    Also, you can also use method annotations to achieve the same result.
    In this case the subclassing must be used

        >>> class A(SharedLock): # <-- Don't forget to subclass from SharedLock
        ...     # SharedLock.__init__ must be called implÃ­citly if not directly inherited.
        ...
        ...     @SharedLock.write_operation
        ...     def append(self, l, x):
        ...         l.append(x)
        ...         return f'{x}_write'
        ...
        ...     @SharedLock.read_operation
        ...     def get_value(self, l, i):
        ...         x = l[i]
        ...         return f'{x}_read'

        >>> a = A(Lock)
        >>> execute(a.get_value, a.append)
