    You may use the lock as a usual lock, but the operations of acquire and release are per
    each kind of operation. You must also specify an underlying kind of lock.

        ...     return f'{x}_write'

        >>> def get_value(l, i):

        ...     x = l[i]

        >>> execute(get_value, append)


    `write_operation` and `read_operation` can also be used as context managers:

        >>> def append(l, x):
        ...     with lock.write_operation:
        ...         l.append(x)
        ...     return f'{x}_write'

        >>> def get_value(l, i):
        ...     with lock.read_operation:
        ...         x = l[i]
        ...     return f'{x}_read'

        >>> execute(get_value, append)


    As an alternative, `write_operation` and `read_operator` can be used as decorators:

        >>> @lock.write_operation
        ... def append(l, x):
        ...     l.append(x)
        ...     return f'{x}_write'

        >>> @lock.read_operation
        ... def get_value(l, i):
        ...     x = l[i]
        ...     return f'{x}_read'

        >>> execute(get_value, append)


    Also, method decorators can be used to achieve the same result.
    In this case subclassing must be used.

        >>> class A(SharedLock): # <-- Don't forget to subclass from SharedLock
        ...     # SharedLock.__init__ must be called explÃ­citly if overwritten
        ...
