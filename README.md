PathEx
======

The main goal of PathEx library is to ease concurrent programming in Python by separating the specification of synchronization from the main logic aspect. In this model, the allowed execution paths are specified declaratively by using constructions similar to regular expressions.

An overview (*in construction*) can be found at https://estog.github.io/PathEx/overview.html.
